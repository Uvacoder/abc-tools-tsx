## Do we collect your data?

No. We do not collect your data. Your information remains securely stored locally.

## Can my configs be kept?

Yes and no. Your configurations may persist depending on your browser settings. Changing or resetting your browser might clear saved configurations. To maintain settings permanently, remember to "Download configs" and "Upload configs" after making changes.

## Are there all tools you have?

No. Our suite of tools continues to expand and improve over time. Additionally, you have the ability to integrate your own tools into our platform.

## Do you have paid plans?

Maybe. As we integrate tools that rely on external APIs, some of which incur costs, we may introduce paid plans to sustain these tools and ensure their functionality in the long term.
